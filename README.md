# Skin-Cancer-Detector-
Hi there! Welcome to my project. This is a web application I built to help identify potential skin cancer by analyzing images of skin lesions. It's an exciting intersection of deep learning and public health, and I'm really proud of how it works.

What's the big idea?

The main goal of this project is to create a tool that can provide a quick, initial analysis of a skin lesion. A user can upload an image, and the application uses a powerful deep learning model to give them the three most likely diagnoses along with their confidence scores.

Important Note: This is not a substitute for professional medical advice. Always consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis.

Key Features : 

User-Friendly Web Interface: A simple and clean front-end built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows anyone to easily upload an image.

Deep Learning Model: The core of the application is a deep learning model trained to classify various types of skin lesions.

Top 3 Predictions: After processing an image, the app provides the top three most probable diagnoses, giving a more comprehensive view than just a single prediction.

Under the Hood: 
Technologies Used

This project is a full-stack application, and it uses a mix of technologies to make everything work together.

Python: This is the brains of the operation. I used Python for the backend, especially for running the deep learning model.

Jupyter Notebook: The deep learning model was developed and trained in a Jupyter Notebook. This was super helpful for experimenting with different model architectures and visualizing the training process.

HTML, CSS, & JavaScript: I used these to build the front-end interface. The user-friendly web page you see is built with HTML, styled with CSS, and made interactive with JavaScript.

Computer Vision: This project relies on computer vision techniques to process the image data before it's fed into the deep learning model.

Deep Learning: I built a custom neural network architecture to perform the complex task of image classification with high accuracy.

How to Get Started

Want to try it out or contribute? Here's how you can get this project running on your own machine.

Clone the repository : git clone [your-repo-link]

Set up the Python environment : Install the necessary Python libraries from requirements.txt.

Run the backend server : Start the Python server to handle the image processing and model predictions.

Open the web page : Simply open the index.html file in your web browser.

I'm excited to share this project and hope you find it interesting. Feel free to explore the code, and if you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out!
